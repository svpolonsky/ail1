[x] CustomerDB -> FaceDB. Location in script's directory
[x] save faces together with encodings

2018-08-16
[x] better position for images
[x] improve robustness. why does sqrt() fail sometimes? - int vs float
[x] face_report : basic implementation, mostly a place holder

2018-08-17

[x] add input from video file (MP4)

2018-08-20

[x] capture.py - record face video, collect test dataset to test my system

2018-08-23

[x] get faces datasets

YouTube Faces (video)

https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~wolf/ytfaces/

Faces in the wild

http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/

2018-08-27

[x] read sequence of videos

[x] write script to renumber YouTubeFaces DB

[x] Resolve issue with face tracker for multiple inputs


[x] generate permuted file with test directories

# -links 2 gives leaf directory only

find /home/stas/Projects/faces/YouTubeFacesQQQ/ -type d -links 2 -print

[x] Add true_name.txt file: I need this to implement Purity measure

[x] add recognition quality estimates on test datasets
   recognition of new faces and returning face_encodings

(a) compare number of clusters
(b) Purity measure


[x] Implement re-clustering: recluster.py using DBSCAN from sklearn

Consider FAISS clustering
https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss


2018-09-03

Initial test results:
cluster/class ratio strongly depends on face comparison tolerance
I have to optimize this number.
To speed this up I should test on images and not videos

2018-09-10

[x] Update clean_DB.py - write face box files

2018-09-18

[x] read face box files


[x] function process_image: test on images, not videos

[x] names, encodings are not updated during operation. Fix the problem.

[] Sync multiple computers with github

Add existing project to github

https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/

push local to remote:

echo "# ail1" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/svpolonsky/ail1.git
git push -u origin master

I use this advice:
http://www.deanbodenham.com/learn/using-git-to-sync-different-computers.html

[] do I need to adjust for bias from frequently returning faces?

IDEAS FOR FUTURE

[] AIL on Mobile Phone: minimize investment in infrastructure
