[x] CustomerDB -> FaceDB. Location in script's directory
[x] save faces together with encodings

2018-08-16
[x] better position for images
[x] improve robustness. why does sqrt() fail sometimes? - int vs float
[x] face_report : basic implementation, mostly a place holder

2018-08-17

[x] add input from video file (MP4)

2018-08-20

[x] capture.py - record face video, collect test dataset to test my system

2018-08-23

[x] get faces datasets

YouTube Faces (video)

https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~wolf/ytfaces/

Faces in the wild

http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/

2018-08-27

[x] read sequence of videos

[x] write script to renumber YouTubeFaces DB

[x] Resolve issue with face tracker for multiple inputs


[x] generate permuted file with test directories

# -links 2 gives leaf directory only

find /home/stas/Projects/faces/YouTubeFacesQQQ/ -type d -links 2 -print

2018-09-02

[x] Add true_name.txt file: I need this to implement Purity measure

[x] add recognition quality estimates on test datasets
   recognition of new faces and returning face_encodings

(a) compare number of clusters
(b) Purity measure


[x] Implement re-clustering: recluster.py using DBSCAN from sklearn

Consider FAISS clustering
https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss


2018-09-03

Initial test results:
cluster/class ratio strongly depends on face comparison tolerance
I have to optimize this number.
To speed this up I should test on images and not videos

2018-09-10

[x] Update clean_DB.py - write face box files

2018-09-18

[x] read face box files


[x] function process_image: test on images, not videos

[x] names, encodings are not updated during operation. Fix the problem.

2018-09-20

[x] Add existing project to github

https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/

echo "# ail1" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/svpolonsky/ail1.git
git push -u origin master


https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line/

git add .
git commit -m "Add existing file"
git push origin master

[x] restructure the project: ignore big external AI files; Database outside the project directory

[x] Choose GUI & install: kivy (in addition to desktop OS it runs on Android/iOS: I see this as a main advantage)

https://kivy.org

Anaconda install:
conda install kivy -c conda-forge


2018-09-25

[x] GUI: Kivy is too complex for me, use TKInter


2018-09-29

[x] TKInter GUI proto (learm TKInter)

2018-09-30

[x] Merge GUI with AI code

2018-10-03

[x] GUI: bounding box to faces

2018-10-06

[x] GUI Report on recognized faces

2018-10-07

[x] GUI reporting into function: learn to pass TKInter objects as argument

2018-10-18

[x] GUI report face: put image in the button (and not canvas). Define callback

2018-10-19

[x] fix colors: bgr vs rgb
[x] resize faces to standard size

2018-10-20

[x] resize video to standard size

2018-10-25

[x] restore live-camera functionality

2018-11-08

[x] Toplevel window to show user info

2018-11-22

[x] face box changes color (new face, recognized,... )

2018-11-23
[x] mouse-clicks on faces simplify GUI

2018-11-27

[x] gui_annotate_video

2018-11-28

[x] gui_suggest_deal_dialog

2018-12-02

[x] customer relations management. Sqlite database to records transactions with customers

2018-12-06

[x] Hints for video gui_annotate_video

2018-12-08

[x] face tracker can loose a face, find it again and assign a new id. Take care of this situation.


2018-12-08

[x] np.array for resize_image_H

[] issue: several boxes can correspond to teh same face - need to fix this

2018-12-08

Meeting w/ Yuri

(1) Can we use gender, age, and emotion recognition
(2) Can we avoid personal data use consent

[S] Generate report for owner (transactions, eventually gender, age, possibly emotion)
[S] Improve metrics
[Y] Define Bonus policy
[s] Send design ppt to Y
[S] check bonusplus.pro

2018-12-25

[x] Improve "Suggest Action" logic, as described in PPT

2018-12-26

[no: use export to Excel for a while] Management Reports with Pandas

2019-01-09

[x] Export to Excel

2019-01-11

[x] ./make_test_crmdb.py: make fictitious crmdb. I need this to work on owner reports

[] Debug accuracy test, refactor code


[] Exit on 'q' key, add Quit button

====
[] Sync multiple computers with github
I use this advice:
http://www.deanbodenham.com/learn/using-git-to-sync-different-computers.html

[] do I need to adjust for bias from frequently returning faces?

IDEAS FOR FUTURE

[] AIL on Mobile Phone: minimize investment in infrastructure
